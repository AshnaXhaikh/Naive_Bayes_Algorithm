# 📘 Naive Bayes & Bayes' Theorem — Complete ML Notes

## 🔷 Bayes' Theorem

Bayes’ Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to that event.

**Formula:**

```

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) \* P(A)) / P(B)

```

- **P(A)** → Prior probability (before seeing evidence)
- **P(B | A)** → Likelihood (how likely is B if A is true)
- **P(B)** → Total probability of evidence
- **P(A | B)** → Posterior probability (updated belief after seeing evidence)

---

## 🧪 Example: Medical Test

- Disease rate: 1% → `P(Disease) = 0.01` (Prior)
- Test is 99% accurate → `P(Positive | Disease) = 0.99`
- 5% false positive rate → `P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.05`

```

P(Disease | Positive) = (0.99 \* 0.01) / \[(0.99 \* 0.01) + (0.05 \* 0.99)]
≈ 16.67%

```

✅ Even if the test is accurate, the disease is still rare — so the final chance is ~17%.

## 🍪 Story Example: The Cookie Jar

- **Jar A**: 30 chocolate, 10 vanilla → P(chocolate | A) = 0.75  
- **Jar B**: 10 chocolate, 30 vanilla → P(chocolate | B) = 0.25  
- Equal chance to choose any jar → P(Jar A) = P(Jar B) = 0.5

You pick a chocolate cookie. Now:

```

P(Jar A | chocolate) = (0.75 \* 0.5) / \[(0.75 \* 0.5) + (0.25 \* 0.5)]
\= 0.75

```

✅ Belief about Jar A being the source increases from 50% to 75% because of the chocolate evidence.

## 🔁 Key Concepts

| Term         | Meaning                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prior**    | Initial belief before seeing the evidence              |
| **Evidence** | The observed data (e.g., feature values)               |
| **Likelihood** | Probability of seeing the evidence given the class   |
| **Posterior**| Updated belief after applying Bayes’ Theorem          |

## 🧠 Transition to Naive Bayes in ML

> **Prior is your belief before seeing the evidence.**  
> Bayes’ Theorem uses new evidence to update that belief,  
> resulting in a more accurate belief called the **Posterior**.

## 🔁 Mapping to Machine Learning

| Bayes Term   | ML Equivalent                          | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prior**    | `P(Class)`                              | Overall probability of each class before looking at input features         |
| **Evidence** | `X` (Features/Input)                    | The actual input features observed in a sample                             |
| **Likelihood** | `P(Feature | Class)`                  | Probability of each feature value under a given class                      |
| **Posterior**| `P(Class | X)`                          | Final prediction: class probability given the observed features            |

## 🏋️‍♀️ What Happens in Naive Bayes

### ▶️ Training Phase
- **Learns**:
  - `P(Class)` → Prior class probabilities
  - `P(Feature | Class)` → Likelihood of features per class (depends on NB variant)
- **Does NOT memorize data** — it only stores probability summaries.

---

### 🧪 Testing Phase
- **Takes features (X)** of a new sample
- **Computes**:
```

P(Class | X) ∝ P(x1 | Class) \* P(x2 | Class) \* ... \* P(Class)

```
- **Predicts** the class with the highest posterior probability

---

## 🧪 Example (Spam Detection with MultinomialNB)

### Training:
- Learns:
```

P(Spam) = 0.3
P(Not Spam) = 0.7
P("free" | Spam) = 0.8
P("free" | Not Spam) = 0.1

```

### Testing:
- Input: "Email contains 'free'"
- Compute:
```

P(Spam | "free") ∝ 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(Not Spam | "free") ∝ 0.1 \* 0.7 = 0.07

```
- Predict: **Spam** (because 0.24 > 0.07)

## 🧪 Naive Bayes Variants

| Variant         | Feature Type               | Example Use Case                    |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **GaussianNB**    | Continuous (real numbers)  | Age, income, blood pressure          |
| **MultinomialNB** | Discrete counts            | Word frequencies in text             |
| **BernoulliNB**   | Binary (0/1 features)      | Word present/absent                  |
| **ComplementNB**  | Text + class imbalance     | Sentiment/text with imbalanced labels|
| **CategoricalNB** | Categorical labels         | Gender, size (S, M, L), color        |

> ✅ These variants refer to the **type of features**, not the class/target.

## ✅ Summary

- Naive Bayes is simple, fast, and works well for high-dimensional data (like text).
- It is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem.
- The "naive" assumption: features are conditionally independent given the class.
- Training = learn priors and likelihoods.
- Testing = compute posteriors and pick the most likely class.
